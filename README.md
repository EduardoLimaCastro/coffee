## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

My first Angular App, it was a very fun challenge for me I was able to learn more about how Angular works, Angular routes and components. I also used Angular Material to build some of the components in the App.


### Continued development

Want to continue and make a profile page, where the user can see the subscription plan in use and change it if desired.
